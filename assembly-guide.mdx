All connections between the Head and Base are made through a **stripped Ethernet cable**, which carries power and data signals. Connections from the Base to motors use the default wires provided with each motor.

## Pre-Assembly Preparation

<Warning>
**Safety First**: Review all safety warnings before beginning assembly. Ensure adequate ventilation, proper lighting, and have safety equipment ready.

### Servo Preparation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Attach Servo Horns">
    Each STS3215 servo comes with two horns - prepare them correctly:
    
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Geared Horn (Output Side)">
        - **Location**: Side with copper gear visible
        - **Attachment**: Secure firmly with provided screws
        - **Torque**: Tighten to manufacturer specification
        - **Function**: Transmits power to mechanical linkages
      </Tab>
      
      <Tab title="Alignment Horn (Input Side)">
        - **Location**: Opposite side from copper gear
        - **Attachment**: Place without screwing (alignment only)
        - **Function**: Provides axis alignment and support
        - **Note**: Not needed for yaw and roll servos
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/servo-horn-installation.jpg" alt="STS3215 servo showing proper horn installation on both sides" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Servo Orientation">
    Correct servo orientation is critical for proper operation:
    
    <Warning>
    **Motor body asymmetry**: The STS3215 servo body is not symmetrical. Incorrect orientation will cause binding and potential damage.
    </Warning>
    
    **Orientation Guidelines**:
    - View LeLamp from top-down with wire slit facing right
    - Pitch servo horns (geared) should face **outward** (away from you)
    - Yaw and roll servos don't require alignment horns

      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    
    <Note>
    If servo wires are too short, extend them by [splicing additional wire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7GlDBge_WU) using proper techniques.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Power System Setup

LeLamp requires two separate power supplies for optimal operation:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Servo Power Supply">
    **5V 2A DC Power Supply with DC Plug**
    
    - **Function**: Powers all servo motors
    - **Connection**: DC plug to motor driver power input
    - **Verification**: Check voltage with multimeter before connection
    
    <Check>
    Servo power supply provides stable 5V under load conditions.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Raspberry Pi Power Supply">
    **5V 2A USB Type-C Charger**
    
    - **Function**: Powers Raspberry Pi and ReSpeaker Hat
    - **Connection**: USB-C to Pi power port
    - **Quality**: Use official Pi power supply or high-quality equivalent
