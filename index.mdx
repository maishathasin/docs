## What You'll Build

LeLamp features three main sections working together to create an expressive robotic companion:

### LeLamp Head
- **Camera** — Computer vision for environmental awareness
- **Speaker** — 4Ω/3W audio output for voice and sound effects
- **LED Matrix** — WS2812B programmable LEDs for visual expressions

### LeLamp Base
- **Raspberry Pi with ReSpeaker Hat** — Central control unit for servos, audio, and LEDs
- **Motor Driver** — Precise control of servo motors
- **Power Management** — Dual power supply system for optimal performance

### LeLamp Body
- **5 Servo Motors** — Provides expressive movement with multiple degrees of freedom
- **Precision Mechanics** — 3D printed components for smooth, reliable operation
