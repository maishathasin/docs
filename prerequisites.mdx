### Raspberry Pi Preparation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Flash the SD Card">
    Download and install [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
    
    **Recommended OS**: Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit) - Debian Bookworm version
    
    <Warning>
    Use the **Lite** version to reduce resource usage and improve performance for LeLamp operations.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Initial Settings">
    In Raspberry Pi Imager, click the gear icon to configure:
    
    - **WiFi SSID and Password**: Set up your network connection
    - **Username and Password**: Create your user account
    - **Hostname**: Set a memorable name (e.g., "lelamp-pi")
    - **Enable SSH**: Required for remote access
    - **SSH Key**: Optional but recommended for security
    
    <Tip>
    Write down your username, password, and hostname - you'll need these for SSH access.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Initial Boot and Connection">
    After flashing and first boot:
    
    1. **Connect to your phone's hotspot** (if using mobile setup)
    2. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for the Pi to fully boot and connect to WiFi
    3. **Find the Pi's IP address** using your router's admin panel or network scanner
  </Step>
</Steps>

### SSH Connection Setup

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash macOS/Linux
  # Connect using hostname (preferred)
  ssh your_username@your_hostname.local
  
  # Or connect using IP address
  ssh your_username@192.168.1.xxx
  ```
  
  ```powershell Windows
  # Using PowerShell or Command Prompt
  ssh your_username@your_hostname.local
  
  # Or using PuTTY with the hostname/IP
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Bracket Bot Network Setup

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Prerequisites for Network Setup">
    - You have flashed the SD card using Raspberry Pi Imager
    - The Raspberry Pi is configured to connect to your phone's hotspot
    - Your laptop is ready to connect via SSH
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Step-by-Step Network Configuration">

        Ensure your laptop is connected to the same phone hotspot that your Raspberry Pi will connect to.
        
        <Check>
        Verify both devices are on the same network by checking IP ranges (usually 192.168.x.x).
        </Check>
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Power On the Raspberry Pi">
        Once powered on, the Raspberry Pi should automatically connect to the phone hotspot.
        
        <Note>
        This process may take 2-3 minutes. The Pi needs time to boot, connect to WiFi, and initialize services.
        </Note>
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Follow Video Tutorial for OS Setup">
        Complete the initial OS configuration following the provided video tutorial until the setup script finishes.
        
        <Warning>
        Do not disconnect or power off the Pi during this process, even if it appears inactive.
        </Warning>
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Switch to Bracket Bot Network">
        After the setup script completes:
        
        1. **Disconnect** your laptop from the phone's hotspot
        2. **Look for** the newly created "Bracket Bot" Wi-Fi network
        3. **Connect** to the Bracket Bot network using the provided credentials
        
        <Tip>
        The Bracket Bot network typically appears within 1-2 minutes after setup completion.
        </Tip>
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Reconnect via SSH">
        Once connected to the Bracket Bot network, reconnect to your Raspberry Pi:
        
        ```bash
        ssh your_username@your_hostname.local
        ```
        
        <Check>
        Successful connection confirms your Pi is properly configured and accessible.
        </Check>
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Troubleshooting Network Issues">
    **Pi doesn't connect to hotspot:**
    - Verify hotspot credentials in Pi Imager settings
    - Check hotspot device limit (some phones limit connected devices)
    - Try restarting both Pi and hotspot device
    
    **Bracket Bot network doesn't appear:**
    - Wait up to 5 minutes for network creation
