# Prerequisites for Building LeLamp

Before starting your LeLamp build, ensure you have the necessary skills, tools, and time to complete this project successfully.

## Skill Level Requirements

**Intermediate to Advanced** - This project requires:

- **Electronics experience**: Soldering, basic circuit understanding, component identification
- **3D printing knowledge**: Printer operation, material selection, post-processing
- **Software comfort**: Command line usage, SSH, basic Linux administration
- **Mechanical assembly**: Precision work with small components, heat inserts, servo mounting

**Estimated build time**: 8-12 hours over 2-3 days

## Required Tools

### Electronics Tools

- Soldering iron (temperature controlled, 15-25W)
- Solder (60/40 rosin core, 0.6-0.8mm)
- Wire strippers
- Small screwdrivers (Phillips #0, #1, flathead 2-3mm)
- Multimeter for continuity testing
- Anti-static wrist strap (recommended)

### Mechanical Tools

- Heat insert soldering iron tip OR dedicated heat insert tool
- M2 and M3 Allen keys/hex drivers
- Small pliers (needle nose)
- Wire cutters/flush cutters
- Digital calipers (for verification)

### 3D Printing Requirements

- **Printer bed size**: Minimum 200x200x150mm
- **Materials**: PLA+ recommended (PETG acceptable)
- **Layer height**: 0.2mm standard, 0.15mm for critical parts
- **Infill**: 20% minimum, 30% for structural components
- **Supports**: Required for some parts (see individual STL notes)

## Safety Warnings

⚠️ **ELECTRICAL SAFETY**

- Always disconnect power when making connections
- Use proper ESD precautions when handling Pi and servo driver
- Main power supply is 5V - verify correct voltage before connection
- Double-check polarity before powering on

⚠️ **MECHANICAL SAFETY**

- Heat inserts reach 200°C+ - use appropriate tools
- Servo horns under tension can snap - wear eye protection
- Small parts present choking hazard
